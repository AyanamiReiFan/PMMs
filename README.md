# Prototype Mixture Models
This code is for the paper "[Prototype Mixture Models for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03898.pdf)" in European Conference on Computer Vision(ECCV 2020).

## Overview
This code contains two methods called PMMs and RPMMs.You can train or test them on Pascal voc or COCO dataset.
The experiments are divided into into 4 independent groups for cross validation 
- `config/` contains the config setting file for data and network;
- `data/` contains the dataloader and dataset;
- `data_list/` contains the data list for training and inference;
- `models/` contains the backbone & PMMs module;
- `networks/` contains the implementation of the PMMs(`FPMMs.py`) & RPMMs(`FRPMMs.py`);
- `scripts/` contains the shell file to use this code succinctly;
- `utils/` contains other dependent code;

## Dependencies
python == 3.7,
pytorch1.0,

torchvision,
pillow,
opencv-python,
pandas,
matplotlib,
scikit-image

## Usage
This code is very simple to use. You can train and test it just follow the steps below. 
### Preparation
After downloading the code, installing dependencies. You should modify the data path and model path in `config/settings.py`.
Note that you may need to check the hierarchy of the dataset in `data/voc_train.py`, `data/voc_val.py`, `data/coco_val.py`, `data/coco_val.py`
### Training
```
cd scripts
sh train_group0.sh
```
### Inference
```
python test_frame.py
```
